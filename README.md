## Brief Description:
The Indah Water Konsortium (IWK) website serves as the online platform for Malaysia's national sewerage company. Owned by the Minister of Finance Incorporated, IWK is tasked with the development and maintenance of a modern and efficient sewerage system for all Malaysians.

Established in 1994, IWK plays a crucial role in managing the nation's sewerage services, ensuring that wastewater is treated before being discharged into rivers. This contributes to preserving Malaysia's water resources, protecting public health, and maintaining a cleaner and safer environment.

The objectives of this case study are to identify, evaluate, and prevent vulnerabilities present within the IWK website, using the OWASP ZAP tool and other relevant techniques. Through comprehensive analysis and recommendations, the aim is to enhance the security and integrity of the IWK online platform, safeguarding it against potential threats and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery to the public.
